    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <!-- paragraph about me-->
      <p>Born and raised in Seattle, Washington.  My parents from Philippines.  I am not bi-lingbual.  I can understand a few phrases and words of the dialect that my parents speak, like "Are you hungry?", "Slippers", "Bathroom".
        However the dialect they speak is not the national language so communitcating with older filipinos proves difficult.  When meeting other filipinos if I don't speak Tagalog or my home dialect, it's always "Why?"
        I always explain that I grew up with my grandparetns and parents speaking Ilocano but me and my brothers would reply in English.  And our English we learned from watching T.V. and school.
